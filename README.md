# Teamplay-Web
Teamplay is a tool that handles tournaments for team sports such as. ice hockey, floorball, football, handball, basketball and paddle. All steps from registration to scheduling and results management are taken care of.

This repository holds the PHP source code for the public Teamplay tournament web page, i.e. the frontend. Data is collected from the Teamplay backend via a (read-only) REST API (description found under teamplay-web/tpserver/rest/doc).

The code in this repository runs on any PHP supported host which means that you can use it to set up your own Teamplay frontend.
